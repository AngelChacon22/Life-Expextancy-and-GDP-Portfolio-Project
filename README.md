# **Life Expentancy and Gdp Portfolio Project**

## **Purpose:**
The purpose of this project was to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis [(EDA)](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section1/eda11.htm) for a codecademy portfolio project. The data was provided by Codecademy covering life expectancy and gdp figures for the years spanning 2000-2015. The data was obtained from the world health organization [(WHO)](https://www.who.int/) and [world bank](https://www.worldbank.org/ext/en/home). The data was examined using a jupyter notebook (python) and focused on generating different plots that highlight relationships between the attributes at both the individual level and in comparison to each other.

## **Tools:**
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Statsmodels.api
- Numpy

## **Variables Involved:**
- Countries: 6 countries contained in the dataset (United States, China, Chile, Zimbabwe, Germany, Mexico)
- Life Expectancy: measured in years.
- GDP: measured in $USD
- Year: data from 2000 - 2015

## **Notable Findings:**
- Zimbabwe had a 31.96% increase in life expectancy from 2000 - 2015
- U.S. and Chinese economies display a high degree of correlation.
- China had a 813.42% increase in GDP from 2000 - 2015.
- Chile had a 211.48% increase in GDP from 2000 - 2015.
- Zimbabwe had a 143.72% in GDP from 2000 - 2015.
- GDP and Life Expectancy exibit a modest positive correlation at the global level (for the 6 countries involved) however, at the individual country level the correlation is much more pronounced. See [Ecological Fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_fallacy)
